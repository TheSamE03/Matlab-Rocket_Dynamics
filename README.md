# ðŸš€ Rocket Motion & Flight Control (Simulink Functions)

This repository contains a collection of **Simulink models and custom functions** for simulating rocket motion and testing **flight control algorithms**.  
The focus is on modeling rocket dynamics.

This is an ongoing project subject to updates and additions
